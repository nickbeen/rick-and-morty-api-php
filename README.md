An API wrapper written in PHP for the Rick and Morty API at <https://rickandmortyapi.com>.

Get all the information about characters, episodes and locations of Rick and Morty with this PHP client without messing around with Curl calls and JSON responses. This library does not return the same JSON provided by the API, but wraps everything in convenient PHP class objects. The Rick and Morty API is made by [Axel Fuhrmann](https://github.com/afuh).

## Requirements

* PHP >= 8.0
* JSON extension (enabled by default since PHP 8.0)

## Installation

Install the library into your project with Composer.

```
composer require nickbeen/rick-and-morty-php-api
```

## Usage

Initiate a `Character`, `Episode` or `Location` model and use the available tools to list, retrieve or search within that model. The library returns a `NotFoundException` when using invalid arguments, retrieving nonexistent models or if the Rick and Morty API is not available. Implement a try block to handle the exception in your application in the best possible way. 

### Collections

Requests for all characters, episodes and locations as well as queries with search parameters will return a `Collection` object containing an array with results.

#### Info object

## FAQ

### What are the limits of the API?
The API is open and requires no authentication. According to the R implementation [Mortyr](https://github.com/MikeJohnPage/mortyr), the API allows 10.000 requests per IP address per day after which any request will result in a 429 (Too Many Requests) response.

### Can I get more than 20 results per page in a Collection?

The API returns 20 results per page by design and this cannot be adjusted. It is however possible to return more than 20 results by manually inserting more than 20 ids in the `get()` method. 

### How about extra filters?

Not possible, this library already offers all the available filters currently provided by the API.

### Why is the code of the episode called `episode` in the Episode model?

It looks like an oopsie from the creator of the Rick And Morty API. There is an unresolved [pull request](https://github.com/afuh/rick-and-morty-api/issues/94) to rename the field to `code`.
